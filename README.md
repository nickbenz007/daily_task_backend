This is a new [**Nodejs**](https://nodejs.org/en) project.

# Daily_Task_backend

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Nodejs - Server](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Backend Server

First, you will need to start **ExpressServer**.

To start the Server, run the following command from the _root_ of your Nodejs project:

```bash
# using npm
npm dev

# OR using Yarn
yarn dev
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app up & running.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `Server.ts` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your Nodejs App. :partying_face:
